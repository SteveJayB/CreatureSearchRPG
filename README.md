Created a program that users can use to search for certain RPG creature characters and see their associated stats. It works by descructuring the data of 20 monsters from an endpoint API to be able to be used to then display creature statistics within the UI based on the user's input value which is either a creature name or creature ID. Dispays the creature's name, id number, weight, height, special ability info, hp number, attack number, defense number, special attack number, special defense number, and speed number. Will display an alert if the user input is not linked to any creatures. API endpoint containing monster data was provided by freeCodeCamp.
