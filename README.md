Created a program that users can use to search for certain RPG monster characters and see their associated stats. It works by descructuring the data of 20 monsters from an endpoint API to be able to be used to then display monster statistics within the UI based on the user's input value which is either a monster name or monster ID. Dispays the monster's name, id number, weight, height, special ability info, hp number, attack number, defense number, special attack number, special defense number, and speed number. Will display an alert if the user input is not linked to any monsters. API endpoint containing monster data was provided by freeCodeCamp.
